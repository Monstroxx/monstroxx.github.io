This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages using the Moonwalk theme. Here's how to get started:

## Customization

1. Edit `_config.yml` to customize your site settings
2. Modify `_data/home.yml` to change the menu and project entries
3. Add your blog posts in the `_posts` directory
4. Customize the theme colors in the SCSS files

## Deployment

Once you push to GitHub, GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your site!
